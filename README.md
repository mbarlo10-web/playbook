## 🧠 What Makes PlayBook Different

Group trips fail because:
- Preferences conflict
- Planning is fragmented across texts and spreadsheets
- No one wants to be the “trip manager”

PlayBook uses AI to:
- Aggregate group preferences
- Reconcile competing priorities
- Generate optimized itineraries
- Allow confirmation, swap, and final lock-in
- Integrate Stripe for premium plan checkout
